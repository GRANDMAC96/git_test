  <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
  <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
    should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>

  <!-- Entities always begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). In between, you put a 
       special code that your browser will interpret as a symbol. In this case, it interprets lt, gt, and 
       amp as less-than, greater-than, and ampersand symbols, respectively.

       There’s a crap-ton of HTML entities. We’ll leave you to explore most of them on your own. -->

  <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
    yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
