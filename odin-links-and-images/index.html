    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <!-- To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. An anchor element is defined by wrapping
  the text or another HTML element we want to be a link with an <a> tag. -->
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>
    <!-- The method shown above opens links in the same tab as the webpage containing them. This is the default 
     behaviour of most browsers and it can be changed relatively easily. All we need is another 
     attribute: the target attribute.

     While href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will 
     be opened. If it is not present, then, by default, it will take on the _self value which 
     opens the link in the current tab. To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on 
     browser settings) you can set it to _blank as follows: -->
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>
    <!-- You may have noticed that we snuck in the rel attribute above. This attribute is used to 
     describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.

     noopener: The noopener value of the rel attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab 
     or window cannot interact with or access the original page. Without it, the new page can 
     use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which poses a security risk. 
     
     In this code: target=”_blank”: opens the link in a new tab. rel=”noopener”: prevents the new 
     tab from accessing the original page, ensuring security. Without noopener, the new tab could 
     use JavaScript to interact with the original page, which is unsafe.

     noreferrer: The noreferrer value of the rel attribute provides both privacy and security. 
     It prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from (hiding the referrer) and 
     also includes the behavior of noopener, preventing the new page from accessing the original 
     page.

     Why do we need this added behaviour for opening links in new tabs? Security reasons. The 
     prevention of access that is caused by noopener prevents phishing attacks where the opened 
     link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users. This is referred to 
     as tabnabbing. Adding the noreferrer value can be done if you wish to not let the opened 
     link know that your webpage links to it.

     Note that you may be fine if you forget to add rel="noopener noreferrer" since more recent 
     versions of browsers provide security if only target="_blank" is present. Nevertheless, in 
     line with good coding practices and to err on the side of caution, it is recommended to 
     always pair a target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer".
